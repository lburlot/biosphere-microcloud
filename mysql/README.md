# Installation of MicroScope MySQL Backend

## Introduction

This component is the MySQL server for MicroScope.

The installation of the MySQL server is based is based on official docker images for MySQL.
See [1] and [2] for some documentation.

## Technical notes

The MySQL docker is based on `debian:stretch-slim` image (see [2]).

We generate the root password for MySQL with the same command use in the Docker.
This is easier to reuse it in the code.

The MySQL client (`mysql`) is not installed on the server but is installed inside docker.

To install the UDF:
* we need to install some packages; this is done with `apt-get` (since the docker image is based on Ubuntu);
  for security, we remove them and their dependencies after.
* we need to wait that the server is started; we wait as long as possible doing other things;
  we implement a solution close to the ones described in [2] (section "No connections until MySQL init completes");
  note that [3] suggests using `mysqladmin` instead of `mysql`.

## TODO

Important:
* We need a lot of storage

Security:
* Create a non-root user for MySQL (agc)

TODO:
* If we use external storage for MySQL, we can't choose the root password [2] (see section "Usage against an existing database")
